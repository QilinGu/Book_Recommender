Hello!

This web-app is still under construction, but check out the demo [here] (bit.ly/db-book-recommender)

The goal of this app is to create a book recommender that allows users to mix and match books they have read, as well as specific genres and topics. Most book recommenders suggest books based on your whole library, or all the books of a specific genre, when most of the time, genres are simply too broad of a category. By allowing users to choose the specific books off which to base the recommendation, they can adjust their results. Lastly, allowing users to up-vote and down-vote recommendations will add supervision to the learning, and impprove model in real-time. 

My method has been to combine collaborative filtering (Singular Value Decomposition, Principal Component Analysis) with 
content-similarity (K-Nearest Neighbors) and user up-voting/down-voting (Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

Stay tuned for the finished product!
